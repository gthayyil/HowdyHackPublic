    <h1>Keylogging</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keylogger is a software that records the key sequence and strokes of your keyboard into a log file on your machine, these files can contain passwords.</li>
            <li>This is also known as keybpoard capturing, the person using the keyboard is unaware that their typing is being recorded. Data can then be retrieved by the hacker by operating the program.</li> 
            <br>
            <li>Whenever you are operating a computer in a public setting, try to take extra caution. You can use a two-step verification with a code that gets sent to your phone to prevent hackers from accessing your account.</li>
        </ul>
