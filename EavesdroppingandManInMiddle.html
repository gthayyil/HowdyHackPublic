    <h1>Eavesdropping and Man in the Middle</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eavesdropping is a passive technique used by hackers to listen to network connections and record high-value information. Interception of data transmissions and other monitoring techniques may be used.</li>
            <li>The success of this attack depends on the hackers themselves not being detected or observed by anyone.
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks involve intercepting the data stream between sender and recipient.</li>
            <li>The attacker establishes two connections: One between themselves and a server, another between themselves and the client. After, they can read or modify the data being passed through their connection.</li>
            <li>The goal may be to record information like exchange of login credentials or the transfer of intellectual property.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Thesw unsecured networks are again the greatest gift to eavesdroppers and men in the middle. If using public Wifi, please use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to strengeth your encyption and protect your information.</li>
