    <h1>Phishing</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phishing is when hackers use crafted email messages to get the recipient to hand over personal or financial information. These emails usually have an increased urgency into their lures to get you to respond.</li>
            <li> Some examples can be "not-to-be-missed" financial deals, a notice that your password will expire with a suspicious password reset link, or an unknown family member asking for money.</li>
            <li>Any or all of these can be the bait that lures you to a corrupted website where an online form steals your credentials or your computer gets infected with malware.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beyond the caution already discussed, common sense is also advised. If you are unsure about a message or email, call or visit the office or person who supposedly sent it to verify.</li>
        </ul>
